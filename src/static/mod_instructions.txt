These are the main modifications you have to do to make a normal PTD3 client compatible with the server:
- Modify the text on the Login/Register screen. You must at least increase the Max Length for the password.
- You might also want to rename:
- - Email  -> Server URL (+ Account), e.g. https://ptd3server-1-noise.deta.app/ptd3save/bestbird
- - Password -> Server API Key, e.g. JgpTobfD5y3SCrjLEW1sGGhSFvX8gAod
- Modify the data sent on save related requests (code.sndgames.ptd3.screens -> screen_Main, popup_Story_*)
- - Add the X-Space-App-Key header (which requires an added Import)
- - You must use the 'Email' (Server URL) instead of poke.SERVER_URL on the network requests 
- - The password on URLVariables is not required (but doesn't breaks anything either), but the Email is still required (for the Username).
- - - If you're annoyed by me calling the URL 'Email' and including the username on it, you can separate it yourself
      and pass it via `URLVariable.Account = username`, that way you can exclude the Email from the url variables

(but I do expect for you to have some experience programming if you are seriously planning to make edits yourself)


Potentially useful code bits:
```
import flash.net.URLRequestHeader;

<request>.requestHeaders.push(new URLRequestHeader("X-Space-App-Key",password));
```

the email can be `email`, `account.email` or `account.playerAccount.myEmail` depending on context
the password can be `password`, `account.password` or `account.playerAccount.myPass` depending on context
